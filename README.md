# Variety Shoe - JSON Data on a Webpage
This demo shows how a JSON data structure (in this case a shoe collection) can be parsed and rendered on a webpage using Javascript. By keeping the data separate from the display logic, we can achieve a clear separation of concerns. 
The principle of "separation of concerns" is a useful idea in many disciplines. Notably, E.W.Dijkstra has described it as a kind of [intelligent thinking](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html#:~:text=separation%20of%20concerns). JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a [Data Interchange Format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/JSON).

# Use/Modify/Create
Being able to read code is an important step to creating your own. So, focus on understanding (Use), before moving on to iterations of your own (Modify/Create).

# Use
Read through the source code to find where the following actions are happening.
- create new HTML elements dynamically
- target DOM elements on the page with querySelector
- use backticks' to make template literals with embedded variables
- use template literals to embed data in HTML markup
- build a page dynamically from data
- display JSON data on a webpage

# Modify/Create
Can you iterate on this shoes example so that it works for a different dataset? What happens if you add new variables to your JSON file? What happens if you adjust the structure? How can you reference that structure in your template?
